        <h2>Academic Experience</h2>
        <h3>ECE233 - Introduction to Digital Systems</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Guitar Hero FPGA Board</h4></li>
                <ul><p>Each week, every lab would add a piece of functionality to a Guitar Hero game on an FPGA board provided by the school. Using schematic design and small bits of Verilog to implement functionality. Checked digital logic using output waveforms.</p></Ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>ECE230 - Intro to Embedded Systems</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Capstone Color Indicator Project</h4></li>
                <ul><p>Combine concepts discussed over the ten week class period into one system using a Texas Instruments MSP430. My partner and I implemented a color indicator that took in serial console input and used UART communication to tell the microcontroller what color the LED should light up, what angle the servo should point out, and what letter the seven-segment display should show.</p></ul>
            <li><h4>Lab Assignments</h4></li>
                <ul><p>Each week, we were introduced to a different part of the Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller in guided labs where we would implement something using the provided documentation to learn C coding, ARM assembly, and how to navigate different pieces of technological documentation.</p></ul>
            <li><h4>Mini Projects</h4></li>
                <ul><p>Each student was required to complete a minimum of five mini-projects which took the concepts from the labs and implemented them together into one system. This meant combining timers and different hardware to accomplish different objectives with varied difficulties.</p></ul>
        </ol>
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>Hancock County Highway Department</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Day-To-Day Operations</h3></li>
                <ul><p>As an Engineering Intern, besides the assigned task in my discipline, I also got to expereience different civil engineering tasks such as bridge inspections, road maintencance decisions, government presentations, and permit approval processes.</p></ul>
            <li><h3>Online Dashboard</h3></li>
                <ul><p>Organized and revized Access database into a SQLite database with more efficient formulas which could be accessed via an online dashboard on computer or mobile for field workers. Helped to make field workers more efficient by digitizing paper work orders, allowing workers to see tasks in process while still out in the field.</p></ul>
        </ol>
        <h3>Allison Transmissions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Online Dashboard</h3></li>
                <ul><p>Configured collected data to be presented via an online dashboard which project teams could download and use in simulations and for further product calculations and improvements. Worked with established Snowflake database to import, alter, summarize, graph, and present data to all project line teams.</p></ul>
            <li><h3>Rgulatory Compliance</h3></li>
                <ul><p>Collected VOC (Voice of Customer) feedback to improve internal product change submission process in regards to the company's regulations committee. Presented solution to higher up executives in hopes of receiving approval for the project to continue.</p></ul>
        </ol>
